<p>If the icon contains two lightning bolts, the charging site has more than one connector. If a filter for specific connectors or a certain charging power is selected, the icon only applies to the selected types of connectors.</p>
    
<h3>What do the different colors of the connectors mean?</h3>
<p>In the detail view of a charging station, the connectors are shown with real-time availability data shown with different colors, as listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#4caf50">Green</span>: At least one connector of this type is available</li>
    <li><span style="color:#f44336">Red</span>: All connectors of this type are out of order</li>
    <li><span style="color:#00bcd4">Teal</span>: All connectors of this type are in use or out of order</li>
    <li><span style="color:#9e9e9e">Grey</span>: No real-time data available</li>
</ul>

<p>This charger has been verified by a member of the community (either at <a href="https://www.goingelectric.de/stromtankstellen/">GoingElectric.de</a> or <a href="https://openchargemap.org/">OpenChargeMap.org</a>, depending on the selected data source), which means that at least one successful charging session has been reported and there is no current fault report. Of course this does not necessarily mean that the charger is still accessible and in working order. If a charger is not working, please report it at <a href="https://www.goingelectric.de/stromtankstellen/">GoingElectric.de</a> or <a href="https://openchargemap.org/">OpenChargeMap.org</a>.</p>

<h3>FAQ about the price comparison feature</h3>
<p>In certain countries, EVMap can show charging price information provided by Chargeprice.app. More information about this feature is listed on a <a href="chargeprice_faq.html">separate FAQ page</a>.</p>

<h3>Which permissions does EVMap need and why?</h3>
<p>The required and optional permissions are listed on <a href="permissions.html">a separate page</a>.</p>

<h3>What is F-Droid and why are there differences between the versions of the app available on F-Droid and the Google Play Store?</h3>
<p><a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> is an alternative Android app store that focuses on free and open source (FOSS) apps. As per F-Droid's policies, apps available through its store must not contain proprietary dependencies, such as certain Google services. Thus, the version of EVMap available on F-Droid contains some changes to remove such dependencies. The details can be found in the list below.</p>

<p>Due to the downsides mentioned below, it is <b>recommended</b> for most users <b>to install the app from Google Play</b> to have access to all features. The F-Droid release is mainly intended to provide an alternative means of installation for devices that cannot access Google services or users who would like to avoid them.</p>

<h4>Changes in the F-Droid version of EVMap:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Map data and place search are solely provided by <b>Mapbox (OpenStreetMap)</b>, while the Google Play version offers a choice between Google Maps and Mapbox.</li>
<li>There is <b>no support for Android Auto and Android Automotive OS</b>, which are both proprietary Google products.</li>
<li>Donations are accepted through a <b>PayPal</b> link instead of the Google Play in-app purchases mechanism.</li>
<li>The F-Droid version of the app should also work on Android devices that lack the preinstalled Google Play Services.</li>
<li>Due to F-Droid's policies, we have less control over the release of new updates. Updates will typically appear on F-Droid a few days later than on Google Play.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mapbox library used for displaying OpenStreetMap maps usually also contains certain proprietary components used for optional telemetry services. These have been removed in both the Google Play and the F-Droid versions of EVMap, to enhance the users' privacy while using Mapbox maps.</p>
