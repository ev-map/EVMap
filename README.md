Development setup
-----------------

The App is developed using Android Studio and should pretty much work out-of-the-box when you clone
the Git repository and open the project with Android Studio.

The only exception is that you need to obtain some API keys for the different data sources that
EVMap uses and put them into the app in the form of a resource file called `apikeys.xml` under
`app/src/main/res/values`. You can find more information on which API keys are necessary for which
features and how they can be obtained in our [documentation page](doc/api_keys.md).

There are four different build flavors, `googleNormal`, `fossNormal`, `googleAutomotive`, and
`fossAutomotive`.

- The `foss` variants only use OSM data for the base map and place search. They should run on most Android devices, even those without Google Play Services.
    - `fossNormal` is intended to run on smartphones and tablets, and also includes the Android
      Auto app for use on the car display (however Android Auto may not work if the app is not
      installed from Google Play, see https://github.com/ev-map/EVMap/issues/319).
    - `fossAutomotive` can be installed directly on
      [Android Automotive OS (AAOS)](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/start/what_automotive)
      headunits without Google services.
      It does not provide the usual smartphone UI, and requires an implementation of the
      [AOSP template app host](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/hmi/aosp_host)
      to be installed. If you are an OEM and would like to distribute EVMap to your AAOS vehicles,
      please [get in touch](mailto:evmap@vonforst.net).
- The `google` variants also include access to Google Maps data.
    - `googleNormal` is intended to run on smartphones and tablets, and also includes the Android
      Auto app for use on the car display.
    - `googleAutomotive` can be installed directly on car infotainment systems running the
      Google-flavored Android Automotive OS (Google Automotive Services /
      ["Google built-in"](https://built-in.google/cars/)).
      It does not provide the usual smartphone UI, and requires the
      [Google Automotive App Host](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.automotive.templates.host)
      to run, which should be preinstalled on those cars and can be updated through the Play Store.

We also have a special [documentation page](doc/android_auto.md) on how to test the Android Auto
app.

free, i.e. the background map displayed in the app if OpenStreetMap is selected as the data source.
