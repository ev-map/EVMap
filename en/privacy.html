<h2>EVMap privacy policy</h2>
<p>Below you find an English translation of EVMap's privacy policy provided for your convenience. Only the <a href="/de/privacy.html">German version</a> is legally binding.
<p>We take the privacy of all data that is generated by using the EVMap app very seriously. In the following, you find a list of all data that are collected and why they are necessary.</p>
 
<h3>Finding charging stations</h3>
<p>When searching for charging stations, the app will connect to the database of <a href="https://www.goingelectric.de/stromtankstellen/">GoingElectric.de</a> (GE) or <a href="https://openchargemap.org/site">Open Charge Map</a> (OCM), depending on which data source has been selected. The search parameters as well as the currently selected area of the map (which may include your current location) as well as your IP address and browser identifier are sent to GE or OCM. The privacy statement of GE can be found <a href="https://www.goingelectric.de/datenschutzerklaerung/">here</a>, and the one from OCM is available <a href="https://openchargemap.org/site/about/terms">here</a>. The processing of this data, including the transfer to GE and OCM is necessary for using the app.

<h3>Map view and place search</h3>
<p>The map shown in the app as well as the search box for locating places are implemented using Google Maps and/or Mapbox, depending on the app version and user selection. This means that IP addresses and/or browser identifiers can be transmitted to Google Maps or Mapbox, respectively. If the user location is displayed on the map, this data may also be transmitted. 
Phrases entered to the search bar are also sent to Google or Mapbox to provide corresponding search results. Google Maps is a service of Google LLC, their privacy policy is available <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">here</a>. Mapbox is a service of Mapbox Inc., whose privacy policy can be found <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Real-time Availability</h3>
<p>When selecting a charger in the app, the app may also connect to separate data sources to provide real-time availability data. This can include any of the following services:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://my.newmotion.com/">The New Motion</a><br>New Motion's privacy policy can be downloaded <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ulfvrpf1itxm/67lpNFhJMEpDB2kU88Rp7k/37a1f4ea5c5bb77b5f5005d0262c1256/NewMotion_Privacy_Policy_2018_EN_6.pdf">here</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.enbw.com/">EnBW</a><br>EnBW's privacy policy is available <a href="https://www.enbw.com/service/datenschutz">here</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.chargecloud.de/">Chargecloud</a><br>Chargecloud's privacy policy is available <a href="https://www.chargecloud.de/datenschutz/">here</a></li>
</ul>

Your IP address and browser identifier as well as the location of the selected charging station are transmitted to one or multiple of these providers to retrieve real-time availabilty data. This is necessary for providing such data within the app.

<h3>Utilization predictions</h3>
<p>When selecting a charger in the app, utilization prediction data may be loaded from <a href="https://fronyx.io/">fronyx</a> in case the charging station is supported by them. This means that IP adresses and browser identifiers as well as a unique ID of the selected charger (so-called EVSE ID) may be sent to fronyx. This is necessary to access the prediction data for the selected charger. The utilization prediction feature can be disabled in the app's settings menu, in that case no data will be transmitted to fronyx.</p>

<p>fronyx's privacy policy can be accessed <a href="https://fronyx.io/privacy-policy/">here</a>.</p>
    
<h3>Price comparison</h3>
<p>The price comparison service in the app is powered by <a href="https://www.chargeprice.app/">Chargeprice.app</a>. When using the price comparison service (only available in certain regions), your IP address and browser identifier as well as the selected price comparison settings, including vehicle model, state of charge and additional filter settings, are transmitted to Chargeprice.app. When selecting a price listed in the app to proceed to the provider's website, this is done through an affiliate link from Chargeprice.app, which means that this action is also transmitted to Chargeprice for statistical purposes. Chargeprice.app is a service by Chargeprice SAS, and their privacy policy can be found <a href="https://www.chargeprice.net/privacy-policy/">here</a>. Chargeprice and EVMap assume no liability for the correctness of the displayed prices, they are only approximate values.</p>
